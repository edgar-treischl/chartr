Helper

I am building a reusable `ggplot2` component in R that should be pipe-friendly (`data |> my_component(...)`), fully namespaced (`ggplot2::`, `dplyr::`, `rlang::`), and flexible for aesthetics, grouping, faceting, labels, stacking, orientation, colors, or theme options. The component should work on raw data (summarize/transform internally if needed), provide sensible defaults, fail clearly if inputs/columns are missing, and allow customization of legends, facets, labels, colors, and theme settings. Ensure all parameter combinations either work or fail clearly, support expressions like `as.factor(...)`, and keep code clean, modular, and readable.


## Installation

You can install the development version of chartr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("edgar-treischl/chartr")
```
